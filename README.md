# WingIt
Creates a trip itinerary on the go, instead of planning the entire trip beforehand. Users choose what they want to do between 2 categories: Activities and Food. They then pick a destination out of 3 choices generated according to the chosen category. Upon reaching the destination, users have the option to either continue the trip and go to another destination or end the trip and have the trip saved in their adventure log.
